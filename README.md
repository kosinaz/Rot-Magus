# Rot Magus

Rot Magus is classic 8-bit roguelike turn-based role-playing game about a lone adventurer who has to face the endless hordes of monsters in the realm of the Dark One â€” featuring dozens of different creatures, items, and spells and an infinite, procedurally generated map filled with deep forests, winding mountains, hidden caves, and tranquilizing lakes.

This game is an extended, browser-based remake of Ronny Wester's Magus built with rot.js and Phaser.

Traverse the mysterious lands, acquire powerful weapons and magical artifacts, destroy the endless armies of evil in close combat or from afar to gain experience, and collect enough to level up and get more health.
